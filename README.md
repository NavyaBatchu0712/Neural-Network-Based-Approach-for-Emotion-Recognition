This research project investigates the use of machine learning approaches to identify psychological states, with a focus on utilising the human visual cortex' ability to understand nuanced information in images. 
The work makes use of a dataset that contains pictures that depict seven different emotions, making it possible to create models for the analysis and recognition of emotions.

Methodology :

The methodology involves the following key steps:
Data Collection and Preparation: Utilizing a dataset comprising images representing seven distinct emotions.
Face Detection: Employing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithms including VGG16, ResNet, and Vision Transformers for accurate face detection.
Emotion Recognition: Implementing machine learning models to detect and classify emotions in real-time.
Analysis and Insights: Conducting qualitative and quantitative analysis of human communication based on the detected emotions.

Implementation Details :

Algorithms: CNN, VGG16, ResNet, Vision Transformers.
Programming Language: Python
Libraries Used: TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV.
Real-time Emotion Detection: Utilizing computer vision techniques for real-time emotion detection.
Applications: Healthcare, particularly in assisting healthcare professionals in understanding patientsâ€™ emotional well-being.
